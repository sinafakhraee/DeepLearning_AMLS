# Deep Learning using TF on Azure


* This repo contains step by step walk-through of setting up [TensorFlow Object Detection API
](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) on [Azure Machine Learning GPU compute instance
](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-compute-instance). 

* It also shows how to setup a training pipeline to use a pre-trained mode [Faster R-CNN Inception ResNet V2 640x640
](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md) to train a new model using sample dental x-rays.
